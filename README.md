# hhvm-ansible-vagrant
A readymade package for everyone who wants to try out HHVM (hack)

Just clone the repository, run `vagrant up` and point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

There is a simple index.php which will be executed in HHVM via nginx.

Please note: This is just a bootstrapping setup for people who want to give hhvm a try, I am not involved with any of the software provided.

Have fun poking HHVM :)
